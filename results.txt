Dataset Used:
 SMS Spam Collection Dataset (5,574 messages labeled as 'spam' or 'ham')

Preprocessing:
 Text cleaned and transformed using TF-IDF vectorization
 Stop words removed and text converted to lowercase
 Labels: spam = 0, ham = 1

Machine Learning Models Evaluated:
1. Logistic Regression
   - Training Accuracy: 98–99%
   - Test Accuracy:     96–97%
   - Generalizes very well and is simple to implement.

2. Naive Bayes
   - Training Accuracy: 96–97%
   - Test Accuracy:     95–96%
   - Lightweight, very suitable for text classification.

3. Decision Tree
   - Training Accuracy: 100%
   - Test Accuracy:     91–93%
   - Overfits easily on text data.

4. Random Forest
   - Training Accuracy: 99–100%
   - Test Accuracy:     95–96%
   - More robust than Decision Tree.

5. Support Vector Machine (SVM - Linear Kernel)
   - Training Accuracy: 99%
   - Test Accuracy:     96–97%
   - Excellent for high-dimensional sparse text data.

6. Linear Regression (converted to binary)
   - Training Accuracy: 90–95%
   - Test Accuracy:     83–87%
   - Not suitable for classification tasks.

Conclusion:
 Best Performing Models:
- Support Vector Machine (Linear Kernel)
- Logistic Regression

Both models achieved around 96–97% accuracy on unseen data, with minimal overfitting.
They are most effective for text-based spam detection using TF-IDF features.
